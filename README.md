# Full Control

Full Control is the Magic: the Gathering Arena helper app for those who always want to have Full Control on.

It's a small Windows tray utility that when enabled monitors Magic: the Gathering Arena log file and if the use is not using full control during a game sends Ctrl + Shift to the Magic: the Gathering Arena client to enter full control.
